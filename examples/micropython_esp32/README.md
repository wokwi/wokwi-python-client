# MicroPython on ESP32

This example shows how to run MicroPython on an ESP32 board. It creates a firmware image with a littlefs filesystem and injects a MicroPython script into it. The firmware image is uploaded to the Wokwi ESP32 simulator and the MicroPython script is executed. The script prints some information about the ESP32 chip and the filesystem.

## Running the example

Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m examples.micropython_esp32.main
```

## Program output

The program output is printed to the console. The output is similar to the following:

```
