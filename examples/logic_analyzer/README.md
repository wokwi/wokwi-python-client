# Logic Analyzer VCD Export

This example shows how to capture signals using the Wokwi logic analyzer and export them as a VCD (Value Change Dump) file. The VCD file can be viewed in tools like [Surfer](https://surfer-project.org/), [PulseView](https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView) or [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).

The example uses a clock generator connected to the logic analyzer to generate a test signal.

## Running the example

Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
python -m examples.logic_analyzer.main
```

## Program output

The program output is printed to the console. The output is similar to the following:

```
Wokwi client library version: 0.2.0
Connected to Wokwi Simulator, server version: 1.0.0-20250126-g3ea8cd88
Running simulation for 1.0 seconds...

```

The `output.vcd` file is saved in the example directory and can be opened with any VCD viewer.
